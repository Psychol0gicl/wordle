# Wordle - The game and bot implementation in python
### The main idea of this project was to implement the [Wordle](https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html) game along with some Wordle solvers (called bots in this repository) in python 

### Now it grew into a larger idea of having a testing pipeline for multiple bots, to see the performances of different strategies
